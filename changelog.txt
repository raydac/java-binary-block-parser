 - added extra byte array reading writing methods with byte order support into JBBPBitInputStream and JBBPBitOutputStream
 - added converter of compiled parser data into Java class sources (1.6+)
 - added method to read unsigned short values as char [] into JBBPBitInputStream
 - Class version target has been changed to Java 1.6
