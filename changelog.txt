Change log
--------------------------
1.4.2
 - added creation of makeFIELD() method for structure types in Java6 converted classes
 - minimal supported version of Android API increased to 2.3.1
 - minor refactoring

1.4.1
 - fixed incompatibility in tokenizer regex syntax for Android SDK [#23](https://github.com/raydac/java-binary-block-parser/issues/23)
 - added DslBinCustom annotation to provide way to mark custom type fields for JBBPDslBuilder
 - fixed NPE in JBBPDslBuilder for not-provided outBitNumber attribute in annotated field  marked as type BIT or BIT_ARRAY [#20](https://github.com/raydac/java-binary-block-parser/issues/20)
 - naming of fields has been made more tolerant, now it is allowed to have field names with names similar to data types
 - improved check of field names in JBBPDslBuilder [#21](https://github.com/raydac/java-binary-block-parser/issues/21)

1.4.0
 - added type `val` which allows to create virtual field with calculated value, can play role of variable in scripts
 - `val` and `var` have been added into reserved words and can't be used as field names
 - added field `outByteOrder` attribute to `Bin` annotation, it affects logic of `JBBPOut#Bin` for output of annotated objects which fields should be saved with different byte order
 - removed deprecated method `JBBPFinderException#getNameOrPath`
 - added [auxiliary class to build JBBP script](https://github.com/raydac/java-binary-block-parser/blob/master/jbbp/src/main/java/com/igormaznitsa/jbbp/utils/JBBPDslBuilder.java)
 - added flag `JBBPParser#FLAG_NEGATIVE_EXPRESSION_RESULT_AS_ZERO` to recognize negative expression result as zero
 - improved Java 6 class source generator to process FLAG_SKIP_REMAINING_FIELDS_IF_EOF for structure fields
 - added stable automatic module name `igormaznitsa.jbbp` into manifest file
 - added support of float, double and string java types, as `floatj`,`doublej` and `stringj`

1.3.0
 - fixed NPE when referencing a JBBPCustomFieldTypeProcessor parsed field
 - added Maven plugin to generate sources from JBBP scripts
 - added Gradle plugin to generate sources from JBBP scripts
 - added extra byte array reading writing methods with byte order support into JBBPBitInputStream and JBBPBitOutputStream
 - added converter of compiled parser data into Java class sources (1.6+)
 - added method to read unsigned short values as char [] into JBBPBitInputStream
 - Class version target has been changed to Java 1.6
 - fixed compatibiity of tests with Java 1.6
 - Minor refactoring

1.2.0
- Refactoring
- Improved tree of JBBP exceptions
- Fixed NPE in JBBPTextWriter for String field mapped to byte array
- Added support of custom field types through JBBPCustomFieldTypeProcessor
- Added JBBPCustomFieldTypeProcessorAggregator, auxiliary class to join several JBBPCustomFieldTypeProcessors
- Fixed JBBPTextWriter, added support of logging for JBBPAbstractField objects
- Added support of payload objects in JBBPAbstractField
- Improved inside script compiler and interpreter to support future extensions.
- Fixed expression evaluator to support single char field names in expressions.
- Added support of expressions in extra field numeric data part (example bit:(field*2))

1.1.0
- Added support to write mapped classes into JBBPOut
- Added JBBPTextWriter to log binary data as text with commentaries,tabs and separators
- Fixed read byte counter, now it counts only fully processed bytes, if only several bits have been read from byte then the byte will not be counted until whole read
- Fixed static fields including in mapping processes if class has marked by default Bin annotation
- Added flag JBBPParser#FLAG_SKIP_REMAINING_FIELDS_IF_EOF to ignore remaining fields during parsing if EOF without exception
- Added flag JBBPMapper#FLAG_IGNORE_MISSING_VALUES to ignore mapping for values which are not found in parsed source
- Added new auxiliary methods in JBBPUtils

1.0
- The Initial version
